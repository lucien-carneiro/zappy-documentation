Welcome to our Zappy documentation!
===================================

**Zappy** is the final project made in our second year in Epitech.
The goal of this project is to create a network game.
Several teams confront on a tiles map containing resources.
The winning team is the one with 6 players who reached maximum elevation.
The following documentation describe all the details and constraints.

Thus there is three parts to this project:

- **The server:** the project core that manages the entire game in a network.
- **The graphical interface:** interprets the commands received by the server and displays a result on a 3d map.
- **The artificial intelligence:** takes posession of the players to make them level up in an optimized way.
